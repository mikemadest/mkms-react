        Looking at the code ?
          This is a create-react-app application

        Why not make a simple HTML page?
          I wanted to showcase some React and it helps me to have something I find easy to edit.

        Theme : Mkms

        It's made as simple as possible as i'm not a designer.
        I like it commented, clean and with correct indentation,
        whether in php, javascript or html

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
